"""Phase 02: remove Discord Rich Presence from custom Plex Fire TV checkout.

Run after phase 01 and the no-MPV movies-and-TV overlays on pinned Plezy 2.25.0.
Deletes desktop RPC implementation, Dart dependency, hot-path callbacks and
target-specific tests. Regular Plezy/Windows sources are not modified.
All source replacements fail closed on changed upstream anchors.
