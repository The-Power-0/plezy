"""Stage C-E: remove MPV playback from exact Plezy 2.25.0 Fire TV source.

Apply after both apply_firetv_plex_only.py and apply_firetv_exoplayer_video.py.
This prepares source for a *later* manual build; it does not build or publish.
No music support is promised for this dedicated movies-and-TV edition.

The verified mpv-android AAR is downloaded as an INPUT only to extract
FFmpeg decoder libraries for Media3. Its MPV runtime and JNI glue are NOT
a Gradle implementation dependency and must NOT appear in the final APK.
